Introduction
============

This extension provides a few plugins to display the Mass schedule for the
various places of worship in a parish or pastoral unit.

`theodia.org <https://theodia.org>`__ has been tailor-made to meet the needs of
the Catholic Church, from religious communities to parishes and dioceses. This
tool is used to share Catholic mass times and has been designed and developed to
be extended to several countries.

In this context, parishes and pastoral units are invited to enter the times of
their Catholic celebrations in the form of ICS feeds (e.g., Google Calendar) or
in a structured way on their website so that they can be easily added to
theodia.


.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

Webmasters can easily add a theodia widget (JavaScript) to their site to display
the Mass schedule for one or more locations or according to certain criteria
(e.g., Masses in a particular language).

The extension goes one step further by providing a few plugins to integrate that
source of information directly into the TYPO3 website; thus allowing enhanced
integration and much more flexibility such as the possibility to deep-link to
custom pages for the various locations.
